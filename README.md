# DiffPrivacyInference
Flake for the 'Verified Differential Privacy for Julia' Project.
The goal of this project is to create a type checker which can automatically analyze Julia programs with respect to differential privacy guarantees.
This project uses both Julia and Haskell, a Julia package with a Haskell backend.

The Flake can successfuly build the Haskell backend, but the Julia frontend part still needs to be done.
